    I was gonna make a D&D reference here but then I rolled a nat 1 so now I am legally obligated to fail with the reference ðŸ’€

    You've done it. You've made it. We've made it, just as the perk in DBD said we would. I will admit, there's definitely some spine chill from the prospect of uni ahead, but FUCK IT WE BALL, IT'S ME AND YOU IN COMPCSI AND ADVANCED SCIENCE AND WE'RE GONNA ABSOLUTELY DESTROY THEM AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

    Have things changed? The wind caught up to us and changed as we did. But I think the best part of humanity is how adaptable we are. Responsibilities and life ahead will come eventually, but for now, we'll just take it one step at a time. Think of life as just one big campaign and we're GONNA GET THROUGH IT YOU AND ME AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW SCUFFED WE MAKE IT 
    <br><br>
    ALSO! MY THROAT! HAS! RECOVERED! LET'S BELT OUT SONGS FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE AND BE PUBLIC MENACES ALL THE SAME WOOOOOOOO I cannot wait for the day when we finally figure out that fry scream holy shit WJAESGBHJDIFSHU

    Dear Alison, to my dear wife, my comrade, my partner in crime. The person who I hugged for the first time in years, the person who I've always been able to share vibes with, and the person who I hope to remain friends with for the future to come, 
    <br><br>
    Happy 18th Birthday. You will always have a place in my heart. 
    <br><br>
    I love you.
